# baseline.scss

This is a super simple SCSS partial, based on [http://basehold.it](basehold.it), an overlay grid for helping achieve vertical rhythm.

`@import` baseline.scss into your base stylesheet. Click-hold your page to view baseline grid.

Note: _Assumes you're using autoprefixing in your SCSS preprocessing pipe_

## Doesn't this already exist?

Probably. I discovered this technique after using the fantastically helpful [http://basehold.it](basehold.it), but have been experiencing downtime due to their not being able to serve it 100%. I decided to put this together to help myself and any other typographers wanting to get grid-perfect vertical rhythm on their pages.
